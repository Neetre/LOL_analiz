## Description

**Read the full README to get the idea of the project.**

As a LoL player, I wanted to create a project that would allow me to predict the outcome of a game based on the champions selected by the players.
Now I've created this project that lets you do just that.
The project is written in Python and uses the FastAPI framework to create a web application that displays information about the game.
For now the project is in the early stages of development, so the predictions may not be accurate, and the Frontend is very simple, but I plan to improve it in the future: better predictions, better Frontend, and more features (live game data).

You can try the application [here](http://lol.figliolo.it)

**Click on the button with the "i" icon to see the information about the game.**

Here is a screenshot of the application (don't judge the team composition, it's just an example):
